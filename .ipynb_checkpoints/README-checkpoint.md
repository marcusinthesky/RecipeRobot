Serves the `app.ipynb` app, exploring recipe ingredients using learnt vectors.

This repo contains:

- `environment.yml` installing bokeh and nbserverproxy
- a custom serverextension (`bokehserverextension.py`) that launches bokeh server
- a `postBuild` script to enable the server extensions and install the local one
  (this last step would go away if the local extension became a proper package)
- A [panel](https://github.com/pyviz/panel) based ``app.ipynb`` used to serve both notebook and app based deployments
